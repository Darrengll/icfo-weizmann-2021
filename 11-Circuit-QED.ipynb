    "In this notebook we are going to model the coupling of a superconducting qubit to a microwave guide. The model is quite generic: we will not care about the details of the transmon, replacing it with a two-level system, but we will model carefully (i) the discrete nature of the waveguide modes, and (ii) the inhomogeneity of the couplings between the qubit and the waveguide. The first feature appears in nano-photonic systems, but the second one is less relevant, for reasons that will become obvious below."
